Compute the spatially-averaged line profile, and plot it against a selection of line profiles from different xy points of the simulation (e.g. every 10th point in the y and x directions), so you can see the spatial variations between line profiles).\n",

You should see the meandering shifts of the line core, caused by Doppler motions. Exploring spectrograms from different slices, try to find a simulation column for which the line core peak is stronger (or comparable) than the intensity in the far wings. Compare with a different location where the wings are much stronger than the line core.
