    "This notebook contains additional background information and/or tips for each of the exercises. Some general notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Read the questions carefully and try to answer all points. It often happens that students miss easy points because they did not follow what was spelled out in the questions.\n",
    "* Please do not edit the green cells, and definitely do not split the questions\n",
    "* Do your best to answer each exercise in one coherent narrative, meaning that you should try to frame the questions in a contiguous body using text, figures, and code (when appropriate), using your own words, instead of just mechanically answering the questions.  \n",
    "* When possible, demonstrate your findings via code, plots, etc. It is better to have the code output the results than writing the results in a markdown cell. This way, if something in the code or data changes, it is easier to update. For even nicer visual impact, it is possible to format the output of code calls and even use HTML (Jupyter makes it easy to display HTML/Markdown).\n",
    "* Try and keep your answers concise and to the point. What we are looking for is your physical insight, not your ability to write long essays. Good scientific writing is often to the point, but it takes a while to learn the difference between short and concise, and how much should you write. "

    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will need to create arrays for extinction as function of frequency and source function as function of height (or depth). Assume that the extinction is the same at all heights. You need to set up an array for height, and then integrate the extinction to obtain the optical depth. Once you have the optical depth and source function, you can obtain the intensity by using the formal solution to the transport equation."

    "#### Collisional Ionisation Equilibrium\n",
    "\n",
    "The Collisional Ionisation Equilibrium (CIE) approximation is valid in low-density plasmas, while the Saha law is valid in thermodynamical equilibrium. Unlike Saha, the CIE is *not* in detailed balance. In low-density plasmas, collisions between atoms, or between atoms and electrons are rare, which means that if an atom is collisionaly excited or ionised, it is much more likely to de-excite or recombine radiatively (and not collisionally). The CIE in essence means that all ionisation happens collisionally (no photons involved) and all recombination happens radiatively (photon creation). \n",
    "\n",
    "You can read more detail about the CIE in chapter 5 of the book [Astrophysics of the Diffuse Universe](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-662-05866-4) by Mike Dopita and Ralph Sutherland (from the UiO network, you can download a pdf version for free)"
