    "    \n",
    "Assume an optically thick medium, where the Eddington-Barbier approximation is valid. A didactic tool to understand the formation of spectral lines is a diagram with four panels: total extinction vs. frequency (top left), optical depth vs height (top right), source function vs. height (bottom right), and emerging intensity vs. frequency (bottom left). It is also useful to plot the optical depth at two frequency points: near the maximum extinction and near the minimum extinction. \n",
    "    \n",
    "In this exercise, you are to create such diagrams and explain in physical terms what is going on. The units are not important for these purposes, so feel free to use arbitrary units. You are free to create your own function for $\\alpha(\\nu)$ (extinction as a function of frequency), but keep in mind that spectral lines usually follow a Gaussian shape (or, more precisely, Voigt profile), and continua can usually be approximated by a line (for narrow wavelength regions). You are also free to select your own function for $S(h)$ (source function as a function of height). It is recommended that you do not set the extinction such that $\\tau=1$ is reached at the edges of your height scale - some approximations will break down and strange things will follow. Assume that the extinction is the same at all height points (unrealistic, but simple for now).\n",

    "### Exercise 3: Magnesium [44 points]\n",
    "    \n",
    "Magnesium is a light element that is produced by nuclear fusion in massive stars. The so-called h & k lines are resonance lines of singly-ionised magnesium (Mg II) and have the wavelengths of 279.635 nm and 280.353 nm. These lines are some of the most important tracers of ionised gas in distant galaxies, in planetary nebulae and the interstellar medium of our own galaxy. They are also very useful diagnostics of the solar atmosphere, studied in great detail by [NASA's IRIS satellite](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/iris/overview/index.html).\n",
    "    \n",
    "The provided file `MgI-III.txt` contains the energy levels of neutral and singly-ionised Mg, plus the ionisation energy of doubly-ionised Mg (Mg III). Use this file to answer this exercise.\n",

    "* *[7 points]* What are the energies of the upper and lower levels for the Mg II h & k lines (relative to the Mg II ground state)?\n",
    "* *[8 points]* Assuming Saha-Boltzmann statistics and an electron pressure of 1 kPa, what is the range of temperatures where Mg is mostly in the singly ionised form? Compare with hydrogen and discuss.\n",
    "* *[10 points]* Making use of the [NIST Atomic Spectra Database Levels form](https://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/ASD/levels_form.html), extend the Mg atom file to include all ionisation stages up to (and including) Mg XI. Make a modified \"Payne plot\" to show only the strength of the ionisation stages as function of temperature for this new model atom. Plot for an electron pressure of 100 Pa and a range of temperatures between $3500$ and $2 \\cdot 10^6$ K.\n",
    "* *[9 points]* In diffuse media where densities are much lower, collisions are much less frequent and the Saha ionisation no longer applies. In these conditions, it is common to use the *Collisional Ionisation Equilibrium* (CIE), also called *coronal equilibrium* since it is a good approximation for the coronae of stars. The provided file `Mg_CIE.txt` contains the ionisation fractions of magnesium (up to Mg IX) as a function of temperature. Compare the ionisation fractions under CIE with the Saha (previous point) and discuss the differences. Which approximation is best on the surface of the Sun?\n",
